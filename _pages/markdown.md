# Research interest
Using the research methods rooted in HCI, and tech policy, I am interested in answering the question: How can we ensure online trust and safety experiences are inclusive and equitable for all, particularly for vulnerable and understudied populations, when interacting with emerging technologies? 

A few directions of particular interest to me currently include: 
* Exploring cross-cultural online privacy perspectives of understudied regions such as South Asia versus Western regions
* Investigating the landscape of frauds and scams on video-based social media platforms, including fraudulent GenAI content.
* Exploring how young adults experience fraudulent GenAI content on video-based social media platforms, and evaluate the effectiveness of current platform policies in mitigating these harms.
