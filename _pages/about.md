 Thank you for visiting my page. If you find my work interesting, feel free to reach out. I am always happy to connect and chat more :) 

<b>I am a postdoctoral research associate at the George Washington University, Dept. of Computer Science. I am very fortunate to work with Dr. Adam Aviv and the amazing lab members in the GW-Usable Security and Privacy <a  href="https://gwusec.seas.gwu.edu">(GWUSEC) lab</a>. </b> 
 
 I graduated with a Ph.D. in Information Sciences in August 2025 from the School of Information Sciences, at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, advised by <a  href="http://yangwang.ischool.illinois.edu/">Dr. Yang Wang </a> and <a href="https://madelynsanfilippo.com/">Dr. Madelyn Sanfilippo</a>. During this time I also worked closely with <a href="https://yixinzou.github.io">Dr. Yixin Zou</a> at the Max Planck Institute for Security and Privacy (MPI-SP) in Bochum, Germany. Previously, I had a wonderful opportunity to work as a research intern at the MPI-SP, for the Spring and Summer 2024, and Summer 2023. My research lies at the intersection of human-computer interaction, user privacy and security, and tech policy. I use both qualitative and quantitative
methods to answer the question: <i>How can we ensure that people’s experiences with emerging technologies are safe, trustworthy, and empowering?</i> I am interested in multiple research topics in human-centered security and privacy: 

* Human-centered Privacy and Security 
* AI Safety and Trustworthiness
* Accessibility Computing (Privacy and Security)

Previously I worked as a Privacy Consultant at Ernst & Young (EY), focusing on developing, managing, and auditing privacy programs for tech sector clients in the silicon valley and greater seattle area.
