Hi! I am Smirity Kaushik. I am currently a the third year Ph.D. candidate in the Information Sciences program at UIUC, School of Information Sciences. I do interdisciplinary research in Usable Security and Privacy (USP) and Privacy Policies. I am particularly interested in exploring digital ad privacy and safety perceptions of vulnerable and understudied population groups.
