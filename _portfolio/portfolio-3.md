title: "Internet of Things privacy"
excerpt: "Internet-connected devices such as locks, cameras, and speakers might make a home smarter but also raise privacy issues because these devices may constantly and inconspicuously collect, infer or even share information about people in the home. In this research, I perform global policy review of privacy challenges in IoT ecosystem and explore end-users' privacy concerns in smart home context to co-design safer smart home devices."
