title: "Inclusive privacy for vulnerable and understudied users"
excerpt: "While many in the HCI and security & privacy community strive to improve user experiences online, there's one notable gap: much of the research focuses on an ‘average user’ from western population, which often overlooks the needs of vulnerable and understudied user groups such as individuals with visual impairments, adolescents, and those from underrepresented regions. To address this gap, I study the privacy perceptions and behaviors of vulnerable and understudied users to make their online experience inclusive, safe, and trustworthy."
